            "\n",
            "1. **Budgeting:**\n",
            "   - With monthly expenses being approximately 37% of your income, you're in a good position.\n",
            "   - Consider implementing a 50/30/20 budgeting rule. Allocate 50% of your income to needs (like housing and groceries), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out, etc.), and 20% to savings and debt repayment. Your current expense ratio allows you ample room to adjust towards this framework.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Increase Savings or Investments:**\n",
            "   - Currently saving around $4,900 monthly is impressive. Consider auto-investing a portion of your savings into retirement accounts (like a superannuation fund if you’re in Australia) or other investment vehicles (stocks, bonds, ETFs).\n",
            "   - Emergency Fund: Aim for at least 3 to 6 months’ worth of living expenses in an easily accessible account. This would mean saving $8,760 - $17,520.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Travel Savings:**\n",
            "   - Since traveling is a hobby, establishing a separate travel fund could help you enjoy trips without impacting your regular living expenses. This requires previous planning and dedicating a specific amount monthly.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Review Discretionary Spending:**\n",
            "   - While dining out and entertainment are enjoyable, consider setting a monthly cap on these categories. For example, aim for a dining out allowance of $300/month and stick to it to avoid overspending.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Digital and Subscription Services:**\n",
            "   - Assess monthly subscriptions like Netflix, Spotify, or any other digital services. If you find yourself not using them, consider downgrading or getting rid of them.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Investment in Personal Growth:**\n",
            "   - Since reading is a hobby, consider investing in books or courses that align with your career goals or personal interests. This could be a long-term investment in yourself.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Tax Planning:**\n",
